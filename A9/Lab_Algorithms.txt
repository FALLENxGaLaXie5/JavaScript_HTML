Exercise 1:

	Postal Code - 93012
	1. Add up all digits
		9 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2
		= 15
	2. Check digit = 5, because a multiple of 10 is 20, and 20 - 5 = 15.
	
	Bar Code: ||:|:: ::||: ||::: :::|| ::|:| :|:|:|

Exercise 2:

	
	
	Approach the stop line
		IF intersection is a four-way-stop or the light is red, stop
		 proceed through when intersection is clear or light turns green
		ELSE proceed through

Exercise 3:

	
	Pick up phone and go to "add contact"	
		
		
	IF address book has spots greater than or equal to 1
		WHILE there is 1 spot in address book
			READ name
			READ number
			DISPLAY name
			DISPLAY number

Exercise 4: 
			

	Solution #2 is the best, because it is the most efficient in terms of amount of code used. 
	#1 does the same thing, but it will take more time to execute and is less efficient.
	#3 will display a more detailed message to the user, but it is less efficient.

Exercise 5:

	SET sum to 0
	SET counter to 0
	WRITE "Sum of "
	REPEAT the indented lines 100 times
		READ number
		IF number is even
			WRITE number
			ADD number to sum
	WRITE " = "
	WRITE sum

Exercise 6: 

	1. Solution #2, because it can easily be changed to fit a larger range of numbers and commands, and is more efficient.
	2. 
	
	SET product to 1
	SET number to 1
	WRITE "Product of "
	REPEAT the indented lines 4 times
		WRITE number
		MULTIPLY number with product
		INCREMENT number by 2
	WRITE "="
	WRITE product

Exercise 7:

		READ number1
		READ number2
		READ number3
