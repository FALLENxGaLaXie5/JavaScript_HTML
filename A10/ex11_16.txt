Exercise 11.16

1. True only if roll1 and roll2 BOTH equal 1.
2. True either if roll1 +roll2 = 11 or 12. 
3. True if roll1 is between 2 and 5, exclusively.
4. True either if roll3 is less than 3 or greater than 4.
5. True only if all 3 rolls are equal.
6. True only if all 3 rolls are equal to 1.

7. This is saying that it is true if roll1 does not equal roll2 AND roll2 does not equal roll3. 
   When there are 6 different possibilities for values, this does not mean it only evaluates to 
   true if all three have unique values. Roll1 could easily be equal to roll3 and roll2 not equal
   to either one. A correct expression would be (roll1 != roll2 && roll2 != roll3 && roll1!= roll3).
